This MEAN Stack App is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is a Virtual Car Rental Shop.

Angular is used as my front-end framework. This app is connected to a NodeJS server that communicates with MongoDB to fetch/save data and to demonstrate CRUD operations.

First Register and then Login to the app.

Select the dates from the main page for which you are looking to rent a car for.

You will be then shown all cars and their specs which are available during this time period to rent. If a specific car is already rented for this time period, then it will not appear in your search results.

You can later view your reservation details under the "manage reservations" tab and choose to cancel (delete) your reservation.

Cars and users are stored within a mongo Database. You are also able to create a car and add it to the database under the "create car" tab, this newly added vehicle is now able to be rented.

This app also features:

A Login System which was built from Scratch with NodeJS

The use of Express framework together with NodeJS

Components that can be reused with Angular

Third-party libraries and frameworks such as Angular Material, Bootstrap, ngx-bootstrap, MomentJS

Route Endpoints with NodeJS that commnuicate with Angular Requests

The ability to upload Images to MongoDB and to fetch them back

Tables using Angular Material which have Pagination
