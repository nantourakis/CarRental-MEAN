This MEAN Stack App is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is a Virtual Car Rental Shop.

Angular is used as my front-end framework. This app is connected to a NodeJS server that communicates with MongoDB to fetch/save data and to demonstrate CRUD operations.

First Register and then Login to the App

Select the dates from the main page for which you are looking to rent a car for

You will be then shown all cars and their specs which are available during this time period to rent. If a specific car is already rented for this time period, then it will not appear in your search results.

You can later view your reservation details under the "manage reservations" tab and choose to cancel (delete) your reservation.

Cars and users are stored within a mongo Database. You are also able to create a car and add it to the database under the "create car" tab, this newly added vehicle is now able to be rented.
